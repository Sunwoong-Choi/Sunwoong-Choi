# Introduction to Computing with Python
## Python is a high-level, general-purpose interpreted programming language.
    1. Good code readability, rapid code development.
    2. Low level program language, such as C or Fortan is necessary to obtain the best pergormance out of the hardware that runs the code
    3. Trade-off between high performance and long development time and lower performance but shorter development time.
      * Use a multilanguage model, whre a higl-level language is used to interface libraries(rapid code development) and software packages written in low-level languages(performance of low-level languages).
## Eco-system of Python
   * Environments : IPython console, Jupyter Notebook, ...
   * Python Language : Python2, Python3, ...
   * Python Package : numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ...
   * System and system libraies : OS, BLAS, LAPACK, ...
      ** Users typically only interact the top three layers, but the bottom layer constitutes a very important part of software stack.
## It is also significant that Python is free and open source.
