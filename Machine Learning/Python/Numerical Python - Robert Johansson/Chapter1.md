# Introduction to Computing with Python
## Python is a high-level, general-purpose interpreted programming language.
1. Good code readability, rapid code development.
2. Low level program language, such as C or Fortan is necessary to obtain the best pergormance out of the hardware that runs the code
3. Trade-off between high performance and long development time and lower performance but shorter development time.
      * Use a multilanguage model, whre a higl-level language is used to interface libraries(rapid code development) and software packages written in low-level languages(performance of low-level languages).
## Eco-system of Python
   * Environments : IPython console, Jupyter Notebook, ...
   * Python Language : Python2, Python3, ...
   * Python Package : numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ...
   * System and system libraies : OS, BLAS, LAPACK, ...
      ** Users typically only interact the top three layers, but the bottom layer constitutes a very important part of software stack.
## It is also significant that Python is free and open source.

## Environments for Computing with Python
* The Python interpreter or the IPython console
    * lightweight development environment.
* The Jupyter Notebook
    * a web application, all in one documnet.
* The Spyder Integrated Development Environment(IDE)
    * write and interactively run Python code.
## Python
 * The python promgramming language and the standard implementation of the Python interpreter are frequently updated, and made available throught new releases.
## Interpreter
 * The standard way to execute Python code is to run the program
 ** On most systems, the Python interpreter is invoked using the 'python' command.
     ```python
     hello.py
     print("Hello from Python!")
     
     $ python hello.py
     Hello from Python!
     
     $ python --version
     Python 3.6.5
```
* Specific versions of the Python interpreter are available througth the commands such as, for example, python 2.7 and python 3.6
