# Universal Approximation Bounds fo Superpositions of a Sigmoidal Function
## Introduction
* Purpose of this paper is to examine how the approximation error is related to the number of nodes in the network.

***
* Related with Fourier representation.
* Dealing with linear combination of sigmoidal function.
** still working on it...
